 🎯 Quick Start Guide 
Step 1: Connect Both Devices to Same Network 
Both devices must be on the same WiFi network or connected via ethernet. 
Check your network: - Same WiFi name/SSID - Same router - Can ping each other 
Step 2: Run the Script on BOTH Devices 
On Linux/Mac: bash ./file_transfer.sh 
On Windows: powershell .\transfer.ps1 
Step 3: Follow the Interactive Menu 
The script will guide you through the process! 
📖 Usage Examples 
Example 1: Send a File from Linux to Windows 
Linux (Sender): ```bash $ ./file_transfer.sh 
What do you want to do? 1) 📤 Send files/folders (I’m the SENDER) 
[Choose 1] What do you want to send? 1) Single file 
[Choose 1] [?] Enter file path: /home/user/documents/report.pdf [?] Port number: 9999 
[✓] File ready to send! [i] File: report.pdf [i] Size: 2.5 MB 
[★] Your IP: 192.168.1.100 
Tell receiver to run: ./file_transfer.sh –receive 192.168.1.100:9999 
[i] Waiting for connection... ``` 
Windows (Receiver): ```powershell PS> .\transfer.ps1 
What do you want to do? 2) 📥 Receive files/folders (I’m the RECEIVER) 
[Choose 2] [?] Enter sender’s IP:PORT: 192.168.1.100:9999 [?] Save to folder: C:\Downloads 
[i] Connecting to 192.168.1.100:9999... [✓] Connected! Receiving file... [████████████████████] 2.5 MB (15 MB/s) [★] File
received: C:\Downloads\received_file.pdf ``` 
Example 2: Send a Folder from Windows to Linux 
Windows (Sender): ```powershell PS> .\transfer.ps1 
[Choose 1 - Send] [Choose 2 - Folder] [?] Enter folder path: C:\Users\John\vacation_photos [?] Port: 9999 
[i] Compressing folder... [✓] Compressed to: 120 MB [★] Your IP: 192.168.1.200 
Tell receiver to run: Linux: ./file_transfer.sh –receive 192.168.1.200:9999 ``` 
Linux (Receiver): ```bash $ ./file_transfer.sh 
[Choose 2 - Receive] [?] Enter sender’s IP:PORT: 192.168.1.200:9999 [?] Save to folder: ~/Downloads 
[i] Connecting... [████████████████████] 120 MB (45 MB/s) [i] Extracting folder... [★] Folder received: /home/user
Downloads/vacation_photos ``` 
Example 3: Quick Receive Mode (Skip Menu)

 🔥 Performance Optimization 
Speed ComparisonConfiguration Transfer SpeedBasic (netcat only) ~10-15 MB/sWith pv ~15-20 MB/sWith pv + pigz ~40-50 MB/sWith pv + pigz + mbuffer ~80-100 MB/s 
Install Speed Boosters 
Linux: bash sudo apt install pv pigz mbuffer 
macOS: bash brew install pv pigz 
Windows: Built-in .NET compression (already fast!) 
 🐛 Troubleshooting 
Problem: “Connection refused” 
Solution: 1. Check firewall on sender’s computer 2. Ensure both devices on same network 3. Verify IP address is correct 4. Try
different port 
Linux Firewall: ```bash sudo ufw allow 9999/tcp 
OR temporarily disable 
sudo ufw disable ``` 
Windows Firewall: ```powershell 
Run as Administrator 
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=“File Transfer” dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=9999 ``` 
Problem: “No network connection detected” 
Solution: 1. Check WiFi/Ethernet is connected 2. Verify you have IP address: - Linux: ip addr or ifconfig - Windows: ipconfig 3. Try
pinging the other device: bash ping 192.168.1.100 
Problem: “Port already in use” 
Solution: 1. Use different port: -p 8888 2. Kill existing process: - Linux: sudo lsof -ti:9999 | xargs kill - Windows: Stop-Process -Id
(Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 9999).OwningProcess -Force 
Problem: Transfer is very slow 
Solution: 1. Install speed optimization tools (see Performance section) 2. Check network connection quality 3. Ensure no VPN is
active 4. Try connecting devices via ethernet cable 5. Close bandwidth-heavy applications 
Problem: “Cannot create directory” or “Permission denied” 
Solution: 1. Check folder permissions 2. Use different output directory 3. Linux: Ensure you have write access to target folder 4.
Windows: Run PowerShell as Administrator (if saving to protected folders) 
 🔒 Security Notes 
⚠️ Important Security Information 
✅ Safe on trusted networks (home, office❌ NOT encrypted - data transfers in plain text
❌ Do NOT use on public WiFi (coffee shops, airports, hotels)
❌ No authentication - anyone on network can connect if they know IP:PORT
✅ Files never leave local network - no cloud/internet involved 
For Secure Transfer on Untrusted Networks 
Use SSH-based tools instead: 
Linux to Linux: bash scp file.pdf user@192.168.1.100:/home/user/ 
With rsync: bash rsync -avz --progress file.pdf user@192.168.1.100:/home/user/

 🎓 How It Works 
Technical Overview 
Sender starts a TCP server on specified port
Receiver connects to sender’s IP:PORT
Data transfers over raw TCP socket connection
Files compressed (if directory) before transfer
Progress shown in real-time
Receiver auto-detects file type and extracts if needed

Q: Can I transfer files over the internet?
A: No, this is designed for local network only. For internet transfers, use cloud services or SSH. 
Q: Why can’t I connect?
A: Both devices must be on the same network. Check firewall settings and IP addresses. 
Q: Is this faster than USB?
A: Depends on your network. WiFi 5/6 can be faster than USB 2.0, but slower than USB 3.0. 
Q: Can I transfer to multiple devices simultaneously?
A: No, it’s one-to-one transfer. You need to run separate sessions for multiple transfers. 
Q: Does this work with mobile phones?
A: Yes! Install Termux on Android and use the Linux script. 
Q: Do I need to install the script on both computers?
A: Yes, both sender and receiver need the script installed. 
Q: Can Windows and Linux communicate?
A: Absolutely! That’s the main feature - full cross-platform compatibility. 
Q: What’s the maximum file size?
A: No hard limit - limited only by available disk space and network stability.
